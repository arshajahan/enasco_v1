        <h2><b><strong>Traffic Surveillance</strong></b></h2>
        <br/><br/>
        Effective traffic monitoring is crucial for ensuring the safety of vessels and installations. In today's modern and high-volume ports, vessel traffic management systems are employed to map and process vessel calls and movements within their waters. <br/><br/>
        ENASCO offers a comprehensive solution by providing both the system and skilled specialists to operate it as an integrated service for our clients. Alternatively, we can integrate with pre-installed, client-owned vessel traffic systems for seamless port management.<br/><br/>
        Our tug schedulers are highly trained specialists   equipped with extensive local port knowledge and a profound understanding of shipping operations. Each has successfully completed a 6–8-week theoretical course on vessel traffic management complexities and tug scheduling, complemented by hands-on training.<br/><br/>
        One notable example of our vessel management expertise is evident in the ports of Gladstone and Brisbane, where we oversee the SLTA scheduling department. With a dedicated team working 24/7 in two 12-hour shifts, we monitor and control all marine traffic in and around the port from our Tug Management Control Centre. Using shore-based systems, we:<br/><br/>
        <ul>
        <li>Maintain communication with tugs maneuvering ships through the port</li><br/>
        <li>Sustain 24/7 VHF radio contact</li><br/>
        <li>Manage a 24/7 crewed emergency standby tug for three LNG plants</li><br/>
        <li>Preserve the integrity of shipping schedules</li><br/>
        <li>Strategically plan tug movements</li><br/>
        <li>Utilize an effective tug scheduling tool tailored to local conditions</li><br/>
        <li>Ensure compliance with relevant statutory requirements (Marine Radio)</li><br/>
        <li>Enhance navigational safety through information exchange with tug crews</li><br/>
        <li>Maximize customer satisfaction with the provided services</li><br/>
        </ul>
        <br/><br/>
        In terms of communication tools, our scheduling department employs various channels such as VHF, mobile phones/SMS, internal domestic radio, email (including non-scheduling purposes), AIS, and privately developed scheduling tools to liaise with individual tugs, provide information, issue weather and safety warnings, and detail the position of other vessels.<br/><br/>

        <h1><b>(Hose) Integrity Management </b></h1><br/>
        <p>Marine hoses used in the oil and gas industry play a crucial role in transferring products offshore. These essential components represent a significant investment and often have extended lead times. They are also the most susceptible part of the distribution chain. Oil and gas marine hoses are constantly exposed to challenging environmental and operational conditions, and they must adhere to stringent quality, health, safety, and environmental (QHSE) standards. Oil spills, decreased reliability, compromised asset integrity, and unexpected shutdowns pose substantial QHSE, reputational, and economic risks for the asset owner, as well as all other stakeholders and the environment.</p><br/>
        <p>The ENASCO Hose Integrity Management Solution is specifically designed to prevent such shutdowns, enhance reliability, and increase asset availability, all while emphasizing efficiency and reducing operational costs.</p><br/>
        <h1><b>Data Acquisition</b></h1><br/>

        <p>As members of the marine industry, it is our collective responsibility to safeguard the environment in which we operate. Efficient utilization of our workspace is paramount.</p><br/>
        <p>In our commitment to environmental protection, ENASCO prioritizes combating oil spills. Despite stringent adherence to safety and maintenance standards, accidents may occur. To address this, we offer a range of pollution and oil spill response equipment designed to mitigate environmental impact. Primarily employing mechanical containment, we capture and store spills until proper disposal can be executed.</p><br/>
        <h2><b>Tailored Response</b></h2><br/>
        <p>The crux of effective environmental emergency response lies in utilizing the right equipment.

Considering variables such as the type of oil and local wind and water conditions, we meticulously select machines and materials to control the situation, minimizing damage to shorelines and wildlife.</p><br/>
        <h2><b>Integrated Spill Response Assets</b></h2><br/>
        <p>ENASCO vessels are strategically designed for rapid response. Many of our tugs are equipped with oil dispersant systems, featuring extended spraying booms. Larger vessels are furnished with integrated recovered oil tanks (ranging from 50m3 to 100m3), collaborating with oil skimmers to collect and store sea surface contamination. Depending on client needs, we can integrate additional 'environmental response assets' into our operational plan, including containing booms, boom towing daughter craft, containerized oil skimmers, and containerized pumping systems.</p><br/>
        <h1><b>Skilled Crew</b></h1><br/>
        <p>Our crews are extensively trained in environmental protection. As first responders, they understand their responsibility and are equipped to act accordingly. Highly qualified and experienced in spill control and recovery techniques, our crews are on standby 24/7. Ready to deploy floating booms, spray dispersants, pump out remaining fuel, transfer hazardous materials to recycling centers, clean water surfaces with skimmers, and treat pollution in settling tanks, our crew is prepared for any environmental challenge.</p>

These test bays, strategically located in various sites, ensure that hydro testing can be conducted safely and promptly. For remote locations, our mobile hydro testing containers, constructed with the highest standard steel/wood walls, enable on-the-go testing operations. The p-test lines are seamlessly fed through the wall to the test area, allowing operators to work safely within the built-in operator safe cabin. The test unit comes equipped with a lifting hoist, barriers, warning devices, and SSHE signs.</p><br/>
        <p>Experienced technicians and crew, possessing the necessary training and certification, perform the tests. All test equipment, including pumps, gauges, and chart recorders, are sourced from international brands, duly calibrated, and certified. Hydro tests adhere to ASME standards, OPS Hydro testing IOP, manufacturer’s specifications, or client requirements.</p><br/>
        <p>As a safety measure, ENASCO strongly recommends the performance of applicable Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) before hydro testing on any pressurized equipment.</p><br/>

Equipment that successfully undergoes an API RP 8B inspection will be appropriately tagged, indicating its readiness for the next scheduled inspection. Equipment with intact seals implies that it has not been in service during the specified period, and consequently, the result of the last inspection is deemed valid, alleviating the need for re-inspection.</p>
